# My Blog

A blog site of mine.
Was created using React on the front-end and a REST API on the back-end.

This was the first project I developed in my life. I started my journey with this site which holds a special place in my heart.
It has a lot of bad, inefficient parts but I learned from all of the bad parts.

I'll keep updating the site no matter what.

- Firstly, I plan to migrate it to Modern React Functional Components.
- On the back-end, I plan to use Serverless approach rather than my own REST API since my own implementation is insecure.
- The design of the site is outdated, I will change the design fully.
